# Audio Modernization (2026-10-06)

This records how openQ4's audio compares with the id Tech 5 and id Tech 6 generation, what
changed in the 2026-10-06 audio pass, the evidence behind each change, and what is
deliberately left for later. The retail parity work that came before it is in
[retail-audio-reverb.md](retail-audio-reverb.md).

## Where openQ4 starts from

openQ4's sound core is the Doom 3 BFG Edition sound system (`snd_world.cpp`,
`snd_emitter.cpp`, `SoundVoice.cpp`; the files keep the BFG GPL header). BFG carried the id
Tech 5-era design: emitter channels sorted by volume into a fixed voice budget with a
cushion fade (`s_maxEmitterChannels`, `s_cushionFade*`), sound classes and fades, and an
XAudio2 mixer that blended a voice toward every speaker inside its inner radius. Robert
Beckebans' RBDOOM-3-BFG replaced XAudio2 with OpenAL (`src/sound/OpenAL`); openQ4 runs on
OpenAL Soft 1.25 and adds Quake 4's retail behaviour on top: the per-area EFX reverb, EAX
occlusion, portal spatialization and Quake 4's volume rules.

id Tech 6 games moved audio to middleware: DOOM (2016) is listed among Audiokinetic Wwise
titles, and its shipped audio is Wwise-encoded. The comparison below is with the class of
features such a pipeline provides (distance filtering, source spread, voice virtualization,
a protected master bus, streaming), not with any one game's tuning, which is not public.

## Comparison

| Area | id Tech 5 (BFG) | id Tech 6-class middleware | openQ4 before | openQ4 now |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Close sources | Blend to omni inside the inner radius | Spread / focus by distance | Hard point panning; the inner radius was stored but never applied | `AL_SOURCE_RADIUS` from `minDistance` (`s_sourceRadiusScale`) |
| Unpositioned sounds | Equal to every speaker | Non-spatialized | Rendered as a point straight ahead | Full spread around the listener |
| Stereo and music | Straight to left and right | Non-diegetic bus | Virtual speakers, so through HRTF on headphones | Direct channels (`s_directStereo`) |
| Speaker layout and HRTF | XAudio2 device channels | Endpoint layout, binaural option | 5.1 forced everywhere; `s_openALHRTF 1` ignored | Device layout by default; HRTF preference honoured; reopen keeps both |
| Resampling | XAudio2 SRC | High-quality SRC | OpenAL Soft cubic spline | 11th order sinc (`s_resampler`) |
| Master bus | XAudio2 mastering voice | Limiter / HDR | No limiter on float devices | OpenAL Soft limiter (`s_outputLimiter`) |
| Distance filtering | None | Attenuation low-pass | None | Air absorption from the room preset (`s_airAbsorption`) |
| Gain headroom | Unclamped sounds above unity | Bus headroom | Clamped to 1 by `AL_MAX_GAIN` | 16x headroom |
| Device loss | n/a (console first) | Device handling | Static voices stayed stopped after a reopen | Stopped voices restart at their offset |
| Shakes and rumble | Amplitude data | Meter / RTPC | Game query returned 0; amplitude stubbed at 1 | Authored camera envelope with retail strength/range; separate audible rumble envelope |
| Sample residency | Purged per level | Streaming banks | Every map's PCM kept for the session | Doom 3 purge rules restored |
| Sample decode | Offline-encoded, loaded per level | Asynchronous loading | Decoded on the main thread as each shader parsed | Decoded on job workers during the level load (`s_asyncSampleDecode`) |
| Per-voice update cost | One matrix per voice | Batched | Filters and sends re-sent by every setter (5-6 times a frame) | Once a frame (`CommitMix`) |

## What changed

### Spatial

- **Source size.** `idSoundChannel::UpdateHardware` passes each sound's `minDistance` as the
  voice's inner radius, which only BFG's unused `CalculateSurround` read. The OpenAL voice now
  sends `minDistance * s_sourceRadiusScale` (default 0.5) as `AL_SOURCE_RADIUS`. OpenAL Soft
  spreads a source over the arc it subtends and over the whole sphere inside it; at half of
  `minDistance` the directional part follows BFG's linear blend to omni to within about 0.12
  up to `minDistance`, and becomes a point source beyond it.
- **Sounds at the listener.** Global, omnidirectional and listener-owned voices sit at the
  origin. With no radius OpenAL Soft renders that as a point straight ahead (front-centre on
  5.1, the frontal HRTF on headphones). Such voices always get a radius, so they surround.
- **Direct stereo.** Multichannel voices set `AL_DIRECT_CHANNELS_SOFT` (with
  `AL_REMIX_UNMATCHED_SOFT` where available). Rendered through OpenAL Soft's wave backend with
  HRTF forced on, the main-menu music measured an L/R correlation of 0.95 and lost about 5 dB
  through virtual speakers, against 0.68 with direct channels, which matches the source.
  Without HRTF the two paths measure the same.

### Device

- **One attribute list.** `openQ4_BuildDeviceAttributes` carries the HRTF preference, the
  output mode and the limiter, and is used by `alcCreateContext`, `alcReopenDeviceSOFT` and the
  checked settings reset. The old HRTF reset ran before the context existed, and context
  creation rebuilt the device without it: `s_openALHRTF 1` still reported HRTF enabled on
  headphones. It now reports "disabled, basic stereo". A hot-plug reopen passed no attributes
  and dropped the layout.
- **Output limiter.** OpenAL Soft's log showed "Output limiter disabled" on a Float32
  shared-mode WASAPI device; it now asks for `ALC_OUTPUT_LIMITER_SOFT` (`s_outputLimiter`).
- **Resampler.** 4,762 of the 5,737 stock sounds are 22.05 kHz, so nearly every voice is
  upsampled about 2.2x. `s_resampler auto` picks the runtime's "11th order Sinc"; `default`
  keeps OpenAL Soft's own (cubic spline in 1.25); `listResamplers` lists them.
- **Units.** `AL_SPEED_OF_SOUND` is set in game units (343.3 / 0.0254). Stock content uses no
  Doppler, but a `useDoppler` sound faster than about 9 m/s would have run away in pitch.
- **Headroom.** `AL_MAX_GAIN` is raised to the voice's 16x ceiling. 57 stock map speakers are
  authored `s_unclamped` at +1 to +12 dB and were flattened to unity.

### Current distance audit, 20 October 2026

The current mixer does not turn Quake 4's authored ranges into metres.
`s_soundDistances [exact shader name]` now reports the last completed mix's
listener/emitter positions, direct and portal distances, authored minimum/maximum,
channel gain and actual OpenAL gain, position, rolloff, reference distance and source
radius. It only reads state; it does not move an emitter or change playback.

`tools/tests/sound_distance_runtime.py` spawns three original retail looping sounds
in a real Hangar 1 session and checks nine distances per sound. It reads and hashes
the effective installed PK4 shader sources, isolates writable data under `.tmp/`,
captures through the engine, and records the tested binary/source identities.
The default OpenAL null output qualifies the mixer/backend values, not audibility.
`--audio-output physical` uses the current device at −12 dB for a separate human
check; `--quadratic` checks the existing optional curve without changing defaults.

The Windows GL runs against client SHA-256
`fbce6a142404a565d6ec9c07bf9cf2ec2ccb472cc23357a1ccf3560b1b33aa6b`
pass all 27 default-linear and all 27 quadratic samples. Evidence is retained in
`.tmp/stage-two/audio-distance-linear-r2/` and
`.tmp/stage-two/audio-distance-quadratic-r1/`, including logs, reports, runner
snapshots and the reviewed 960×540 in-game captures.

| Original shader | Authored range (map units) | Inner radius / OpenAL radius | Near gain, before master |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `weapon_lightninggun_fireloop` | 40–1000 | 40 / 20 | 0.3250000 |
| `weapon_lightninggun_hum` | 80–900 | 80 / 40 | 0.4596194 |
| `ambient_light_hum01` | 40–250 | 40 / 20 | 0.0255921 |

Positions sent to OpenAL retain the source/listener separation in map units.
`AL_REFERENCE_DISTANCE` remains 1, but `AL_ROLLOFF_FACTOR` is 0: OpenAL does not
apply a second distance curve. The engine applies the authored curve and the
retail speaker fraction of 0.65. Its existing gain convention is `2^(dB/6)`.
`LengthFast` can underestimate Euclidean distance by about 0.17%; the checks compare
that distance with independently measured coordinates and then check the resulting
gain. Channels below the existing 1/1024 gain threshold release their hardware
voice, including these fixtures at their authored maximum.

The first run, `.tmp/stage-two/audio-distance-linear-r1/`, remains a failed harness
calibration record: `setviewpos`/teleport raised the eye by 0.5 units, the first
expectation used a different dB convention, and a stock speaker shared the ambient
shader. The corrected test pins the intended eye position and identifies its
emitter by origin. Eight parser/assessment tests include negative controls for
unit conversion, extra attenuation, changed gain/radius, stopped/missing voices,
ambiguous emitters and incomplete execution.

These are controlled dry-path measurements with portal occlusion, air filtering
and reverb disabled in the isolated profile. They do not replace the existing
reverb/HRTF evidence or qualify different endpoints. No attenuation, source-radius,
HRTF, EFX or reverb defaults changed. The physical distance check is still pending.

### Mixing and timing

- **Recycled channels.** `idBlockAlloc` hands back channels without constructing them, and
  `StartSound` did not reset the fade. After a map script faded a sound to -80 dB and removed
  it (11 stock map scripts, among them hangar1, hub1, tram1, walker and putra), the next sound to get that
  channel played silent. `AllocSoundChannel` now resets the channel.
- **Slow motion.** The weapon wheel runs the game at 0.18x and the voices pitch down with it,
  but channel completion ran on wall-clock time, so a line of dialogue stopped about a third of
  the way in. The channel clock now integrates the voice's whole playback rate, shared with the
  pitch (`SoundChannelPlaybackRate`). Music keeps its tempo through slow motion.
- **Silent dialogue.** Voice-over cannot be muted without losing its lip sync, and a silent
  unmutable channel was skipped by the update, so it kept playing at its last gain: on through
  alt-tab with `s_muteUnfocused 1`, and through a door that had just closed. Such channels now
  update at zero gain.
- **Inferred VO.** The BFG rule that marks `sound/vo/` and `sound/guis/` shaders as voice-over
  also set retail's `SSF_IS_VO`, which retail reserves for lip-synced speech and which skips
  `s_speakerFraction`. Map speakers playing VO were 3.7 dB louder than retail. Only openQ4's own
  `SSF_VO` is inferred now.
- **no_dups.** Retail's fixed channel slots kept a finished sound's sample, so `no_dups` also
  skipped the variant that had just ended. Each emitter now remembers its last eight starts.
- **Cushion fade.** `s_cushionFadeRate` is applied per second of sound time instead of per
  1/60 s update, which ran four times too fast at 240 fps.
- **Global channels at range.** An emitter beyond the `maxDistance` of its positional channels
  returned before updating its global channels too; they play at any distance.
- **One commit per frame.** The OpenAL voice's mix setters only record their value and
  `CommitMix` sends the filters and sends once a frame. It still runs every frame, so the
  sends follow the listener's reverb slot between areas.

### Shakes, rumble and sound-driven lights

`idSoundSystem::CurrentShakeAmplitudeForPosition`, which `idPlayerView::CalculateShake` and
`idEarthQuake` call, previously returned 0. The first restoration reused the material/light
amplitude and mixer falloff, producing excessive shake, particularly in Air Defense. Camera
shake now follows its own retail calculation: the authored 30 Hz `shakeData` envelope uses
600 units per letter instead of the light-flicker scale of 2800, and direct distance is
measured in Quake 4 map units. Shader volume, `shakes` and distance falloff are applied before
the arctangent; channels on one emitter take their maximum, and independent emitters add.
The query uses the supplied position and the current playback clock, independently of the
master volume, hardware voice budget and audio mix. Missing `shakeData` and `no_flicker`
do not invent camera motion. `s_constantAmplitude` holds lights constant and suppresses shake.

The stock `airdefense_cannon_fire` (`shakes 1`, -4 dB) has a nearby peak of about 0.358
degrees, about 0.183 at 2750 map units, and zero at its 5000-unit maximum. Rumble and
sound-driven lights retain their existing envelope, including the measured PCM fallback.
`s_showVoices 1` prints the separate shake and rumble totals. See
[screen-shake regression evidence](screen-shake-regression.md) for the retail verification
and tests.

### Memory and loading

- **Level purge.** `LoadSample` marked every sample never-purge. It now follows Doom 3's sound
  cache: samples first referenced outside a level load stay resident, `BeginLevelLoad` clears
  the level marks without freeing, `EndLevelLoad` frees what the new level did not reference,
  and a purged sample reloads when referenced again. `airdefense1` then `airdefense2` held 233
  MB of PCM and now hold 121 MB after "582 sound samples from earlier levels freed (111.8 MB)".
  `s_restart` reloads only the resident set.
- **Decode on the job workers.** During a level load `LoadSample` reads and opens each Ogg on
  the main thread, which fixes the sample's length, rate and channels at once, and a
  low-priority job decodes the PCM while the rest of the level loads. Whatever reads the PCM
  first waits for it (`FinishDecode` from the upload, `FreeData` and `EnsureCpuPayload`), and
  `EndLevelLoad` uploads the rest. At most 48 decodes are outstanding; beyond that, and with
  `jobs_enable 0`, the main thread decodes as before. A failed decode takes the normal
  synchronous probe, so fallbacks to other variants and the default are unchanged.
  The main thread only reads the file and the page headers: the channels and rate from the
  identification header and the length from the end-of-stream granule
  (`SoundSample_PeekOggInfo`, which matches stb_vorbis on all 5,690 stock files); the job opens
  the stream and checks all three before decoding. In the optimized build the sound share of
  `airdefense1`'s game media precache (`com_showLevelLoadTimes 1`) fell from about 970 ms to
  270 ms of main-thread time, and an earlier cut that still parsed the headers on the main
  thread measured the whole warm load at 12.40 s against 13.10 s (medians of three).
- **Ogg decode.** `LoadOgg` opens the stream, sizes the buffer from its length and decodes
  straight into it. `stb_vorbis_decode_memory` grew a scratch buffer by doubling and copied it
  out: two to three times a sound's PCM at peak and a full copy of every sound. A stream that
  decodes short now warns. Offline, every stock Ogg (5,690 files, 1.23 GB of PCM) decodes
  byte-identical to `stb_vorbis_decode_memory` and slightly faster (10.9 s against 11.1 s on
  one core).
- **Robust loading.** A failed loader attempt frees itself instead of uploading the default
  beep, which a later language variant then found in place of its own audio. Out-of-range
  ADPCM predictors, XMA2 and more-than-stereo PCM are refused at load with a warning; they
  used to end the session (`common->Error`) or play as noise. `s_noSound 1; s_restart;
  s_noSound 0` keeps the restart pending instead of starting voices on emptied samples.

### Presets

Every performance preset keeps room reverb on (`s_useEAXReverb 1`); see
`Common_MigrateLegacyAudioDefaults` in `src/framework/Common.cpp` for the one-time step that
restores it on profiles still on the minimum, lowpower or performance preset.

## Deferred

- **Audible distance units.** Current `DOOM_TO_METERS` and `METERS_TO_DOOM` are both
  `1.0f` in `src/sound/sound.h`; the earlier claim that the mixer necessarily converts
  map units to metres is stale. The current distance audit above establishes the
  dry-path attenuation, reference distance and source radius on Windows. Human
  audibility remains pending under AUD-01. Reverb and HRTF retain their separate
  qualifications; camera shake already has its separate game-unit path.
- **Streaming music and long voice-over.** All 43 music tracks decode to 393 MB of PCM. The
  voice already queues three buffers; streaming from the compressed Ogg would hold about 33 MB.
- **Centre channel on 5.1.** `SetCenterChannel`, `SSF_CENTER` and `s_centerFractionVO` have no
  OpenAL equivalent in use; voice-over on 5.1 is spread like any listener sound.
- **Mod reverb room rolloff.** OpenAL Soft applies an effect's room rolloff with distances in
  game units. Stock presets use 0; a mod preset with a room rolloff gets far too much.
- **HDR audio, ducking, geometric obstruction.** These change the authored mix or need new
  per-sound data; they are not defaults for stock content.
- **Voice budget.** 48 voices stay (retail mixed 24 channels).

## Verifying

- `tools/tests/sound_settings.py` and `tools/tests/sound_recovery.py` (the device-layout and
  limiter paths), `tools/tests/sound_retail_reverb_contract.py`,
  `tools/tests/sound_distance.py` (distance-harness failure controls),
  `tools/tests/sound_screen_shake.py` (camera strength, range and aggregation),
  `tools/tests/macos_openal_provider_policy.py`, `tools/tests/ui_performance_presets.py` and the
  in-engine `performancePresetSelfTest`.
- The log reports `OpenAL voices: source radius on, direct stereo on (remixed), resampler 11th
  order Sinc` and `OpenAL output limiter: on`.
- Audible checks without a device: point `ALSOFT_CONF` at a config with `drivers=wave` and a
  `[wave] file=` path, as in [retail-audio-reverb.md](retail-audio-reverb.md).
