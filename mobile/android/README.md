# Standalone Android application

This SDL3 Activity hosts Emile Belanger's Android/GLES port without SigmaTouch.
It supports the engine's SDL gamepad, mouse, keyboard and menu touch input; the
configurable SigmaTouch overlay remains an optional, separately licensed host.

## Release download

The manual release workflow includes an experimental, release-signed
`openq4-<version>-android-arm64-experimental.apk`. Install it on an ARM64 device
with Android 7.0/API 24 or later and OpenGL ES 3.0, then provide your retail
assets as described below. Physical-device gameplay has not been qualified.
The APK uses the same menu defaults as desktop packages.

Published APKs use the same persistent certificate for updates. A local debug
APK uses a different certificate; back up its private saves before uninstalling
it to switch to the release APK. Do not clear app data to update a release APK.

## Build locally

Build the native Android targets and run Meson install first, following
[the Android build guide](../../docs/dev/android-build.md). The staging directory
must contain `lib/libquake4.so`, `lib/libSDL3.so`, the renderer/game modules and
their shared dependencies, plus `baseoq4/pak0.pk4` and the remaining staged packs.

Use Java 17 or 21, Gradle 8.12, and Android SDK platform 35. Supply the same SDL3
source tree used for the native library (currently SDL 3.4.16):

```sh
gradle -p mobile/android \
  --project-cache-dir=/absolute/path/to/openQ4/.tmp/android-gradle-project \
  -Psdl3SourceRoot=/path/to/SDL3-3.4.16 \
  -Popenq4Stage=/path/to/openQ4/.install/android/arm64-v8a \
  assembleDebug
```

Set `ANDROID_HOME` to an installed Android SDK, or set `sdk.dir` in the ignored
`mobile/android/local.properties`. The APK is written under
`builddir/android-apk/app/outputs/apk/debug/`. Native compilation stays in Meson;
Gradle only packages staged libraries and openQ4-owned overlays. Android currently targets `arm64-v8a` and API 24 or later.

Gradle uses a 4 GiB heap and at most two workers. PK4 assets are already
compressed archives and are stored directly in the APK to avoid redundant
compression and intermittent heap exhaustion during release packaging.

Meson installation writes `android-build.json` beside `lib/`; the host requires
that metadata and uses its native API as the APK's minimum Android version.
The supplied SDL Java source version must match the staged native SDL library.
Do not mix Java classes and native libraries from different SDL releases.

The APK version name comes from the staged `baseoq4/mod.json`, and its default
version code is `major * 1000000 + minor * 1000 + patch` (for example, `0.13.1`
becomes `13001`). Distributors publishing multiple APKs with the same engine
version, including prereleases, can provide an increasing
`-Popenq4VersionCode=<integer>`; preserve increasing codes across later releases.

Use an absolute `--project-cache-dir` path: Gradle resolves a relative path
against `mobile/android`, which can otherwise place generated cache files in
the source tree. Compiler and APK intermediates remain under `builddir/`.

The APK retains the full official openQ4 overlay packs. First launch also
copies those packs into private storage;
allow room for both the APK and extracted content, plus the retail installation
and saves.

Install the APK, then copy the **contents of your licensed retail `q4base`** to
`/sdcard/Android/data/com.darkmatter.openq4/files/q4base/`. The engine's original
PK4 verification remains enabled. No retail game data is included in the APK.

```sh
adb install builddir/android-apk/app/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb shell mkdir -p /sdcard/Android/data/com.darkmatter.openq4/files/q4base
adb push /path/to/Quake4/q4base/. /sdcard/Android/data/com.darkmatter.openq4/files/q4base/
adb shell am start -n com.darkmatter.openq4/.OpenQ4Activity
```

The default launch opens single-player. To start with multiplayer menus, close
the existing app and launch with `--ez multiplayer true`; `ui_autoJoin` is set
explicitly to `0`. The normal gamepad and keyboard bindings work in gameplay.
The standalone app does not provide a full touch gameplay overlay.

The Android Back button or gesture follows the game's menu/pause navigation.
Fatal-error screens accept touch release on density-scaled Copy, Clear and Quit
buttons; Back dismisses the error screen. Dragging more than 8 dp or lifting
outside the pressed button cancels its action. The fatal screen does not open
the on-screen keyboard. These input paths remain subject to physical-device
qualification as part of the experimental Android package.

On Android 11 and later, the SDL surface stays inside the display cutout, with
a black strip beside the camera hole. Rendering and input therefore share the
same content coordinates. Density changes keep the existing native Activity
session. The app currently selects either landscape orientation; portrait and
physical cutout/rotation/input qualification remain in progress.

Saves/configuration/logs live in private `files/saves/baseoq4/`, and generated
texture caches live in the Android cache directory. With a debug APK, retrieve
the engine log using:

```sh
adb shell run-as com.darkmatter.openq4 cat files/saves/baseoq4/logs/openq4.log
```

When a native fatal error writes a diagnostic report, it is beside that log at
`files/saves/baseoq4/logs/fatal.txt`. The standalone host publishes
`OPENQ4_SAVE_ROOT` before native startup so early diagnostics use the same root
as `fs_savepath`. External hosts may publish their absolute save directory in
that variable; otherwise the existing `USER_FILES/quake4` or SDL private-storage
fallback remains in use. This does not provide release-APK log export yet.

Each packaged overlay revision extracts to its own private directory before
engine startup. A manifest verifies every extracted file on each launch; missing,
truncated or altered copies are repaired from the APK. Healthy files are not
recopied. An interrupted repair is retried, and a replacement is installed only
after its complete length and hash have been verified. Allow enough free storage
for a temporary replacement of a damaged file. Old generated revisions are
removed only after the current package is complete, so updates do not retain
another full copy indefinitely. Saves are kept separately. App data removal also removes
these copies and local saves. The native libraries must be extracted by the
package manager. Gradle's `useLegacyPackaging` setting writes the corresponding
`extractNativeLibs` attribute into the packaged manifest.

The custom Activity and build files are openQ4 GPL-3.0-or-later sources. SDL's
Android Java classes are referenced directly from the supplied source tree;
they retain [SDL's zlib license](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/release-3.4.10/LICENSE.txt).
The SDL Activity contract and Gradle versions follow
[SDL 3.4.10's Android project](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/tree/release-3.4.10/android-project).
No SDL template source is copied into this repository.

## Release automation and signing

`.github/workflows/android-build.yml` can build the APK independently and is
also required by Manual Releases. It uses NDK r27d, Java 17, Gradle 8.12 and SDK
35. SDL comes from the repository's checksum-pinned wrap with its patches;
OpenAL Soft remains at the qualified Android 1.24.3 baseline because 1.25.2
does not compile with NDK r27d's libc++ ranges support. The dependency source download
contains the actual patched SDL tree, the exact OpenAL archive and build
recipes. [SDL](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) retains its zlib license and
[OpenAL Soft](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft) its LGPL terms. Both libraries
are dynamically linked; rebuild with replacement libraries and sign your own
APK when modifying them.

The workflow requires four repository Actions secrets:
`ANDROID_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `ANDROID_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD`,
`ANDROID_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD` and `ANDROID_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS`. It builds an
unsigned release APK, aligns it, signs it using `apksigner`, then checks the
signature against the public certificate in `release-signing-cert.pem`.
Private keys and passwords never belong in Git or downloadable artifacts.
Preserve a secure independent backup of the signing key: future in-place
updates must retain the same signing identity. See Android's
[app signing guidance](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing).

For this repository's initial release key, the persistent local backup is
under ignored `.private/android-signing/`, restricted to the creating Windows
user. Its password backup is protected by Windows DPAPI and requires that user
and machine. Move an independent secure backup before replacing that account or
machine; GitHub secrets cannot be downloaded as a key backup.

`verify_android_apk.py` also checks the application ID, version/API, non-debug
manifest, native-library extraction, 16 KiB alignment, all seven libraries,
overlay bytes and license notices. APK publication is blocked if any check or
any desktop build fails. This packaging validation does not replace device
installation and gameplay testing.

The extraction manifest and its content revision are also checked against the
validated stage. The host rejects malformed metadata and unexpected links or
unlisted files in its private package tree. These checks do not replace the
engine's validation of the separately supplied retail PK4s.

## Validation

The standalone debug APK was assembled with Gradle 8.12, Android plugin 8.7.3,
SDK/build-tools 35 and the matching SDL 3.4.10 Java/native sources. Its APK v2
signature, ZIP alignment and packaged manifest were verified. All seven native
libraries, both overlay packs, mod metadata, contributor credits and dependency
notices match the Meson staging files. Device installation and gameplay have
not been tested as part of this integration.

The host's extraction/retry and upgrade cleanup are exercised by
`python tools/tests/android_host_storage.py` with a JDK. The test compiles the
actual Activity with minimal Android API substitutes and runs against temporary
filesystem fixtures; it does not require or control an Android device.

`python tools/tests/android_retail_data.py` checks the setup verifier against the
native PK4 checksum implementation and generated valid/damaged archives. It
requires a JDK and GCC or Clang; `--retail-root /path/to/q4base` additionally
performs a read-only full check of local retail media. This backend is not yet
connected to the Activity's startup flow. Manual data placement and the engine's
own validation remain in use until guided setup is integrated.
